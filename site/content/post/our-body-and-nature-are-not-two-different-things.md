Ayurveda is a science of daily living, and this system of knowledge evolved from the Rishis' practical, philosophical, and spiritual illumination. This system understands the relationship between living beings and nature. Living beings and their environment share the same core energy on a metaphysical level, such as the panchamahabhutas, panchatanmatras, and the qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas. This idea of similarity is known as ‘loka purusha saamya siddhanta’ in Ayurveda, where loka means environment and purusha means living being. This concept is first mentioned in the Yajurveda and later in the Samkhya Darshan, as well as by Acharya Charaka.

According to this theorem, whatever exists in the universe (brahmanda) has a miniature form within us. Just as the sun, moon, and air create different seasons and weather patterns, maintaining nature in harmonious rhythms, humans are the epitome of this universe, sharing similarities across many dimensions. the role of sun, moon and air is done by Tridosha creating pattern of physiological activities inside human body. Human health and disease are linked to what is present in the universe. Therefore, an individual's health is directly or indirectly connected to their diet, activities, environment, and the effects of the seasons.

**Seasons and Human Health**

Just as the sun, moon, and air influence weather, we also possess tr-biophysiological energies that nourish, provide warmth, and facilitate movement, known as tridosha. As the seasons change—affecting temperature, humidity, and daylight—different phases emerge in both the environment (loka) and living beings (purusha).

 

As a result of seasonal changes, plants undergo transformations, such as falling leaves, green bushes, flowering, and fruiting. Similarly, doshas go through various stages in different seasons, following the pattern of sanchaya (accumulation), prakopa (elevation), and prashamana (alleviation). This progression of doshas is an unavoidable cycle of nature .

**The Role of Ritu-Charya**

Ritu-charya refers to lifestyle and dietary routines that help us cope with the impacts of seasonal changes, as recommended by Ayurveda. It is an important aspect of preventive medicine in Ayurveda, assisting in acclimatizing to seasonal changes without disrupting the body’s homeostasis. Different seasons have distinct ritu-charya guidelines.



**Vasanta Ritu-Charya: Diet and Activities Recommended for Spring**

Vasanta ritu, which spans from mid-March to mid-May (Chaitra and Baisakha in the Nepali calendar), brings an air filled with the scents of fruit flowers like mango, cherries, bombax, citrus fruits, and rhododendron. During this season, the air gradually becomes drier, and sunlight grows warmer, leading to a drier overall environment. This natural effect results in astringent tastes in plants, low humidity in the air, and a diminished digestive fire in living beings.

 

In this season, it is recommended to consume more astringent, bitter, and pungent-tasting foods. Daytime sleep, along with sweet, cold, and heavy foods, should be avoided. Dairy products, newly harvested grains, and fine flour products should be consumed in minimal amounts. Engaging in flower garden meetings, wearing fragrant flower garlands, and using dishes adorned with prints of flowers like lotus and mango flower  are also encouraged.

 

**Effects of Vasanta Ritu on Human Health**

During Vasanta ritu, digestive fire may decrease, and kapha dosha may progress to the prakopa stage. This results in an increased likelihood of illnesses such as laziness, sore throat, heaviness in the body and head, body aches, and other kapha-related diseases. To mitigate the effects of kapha dosha during its prakopa phase, Ayurveda recommends following Vasanta ritu-charya.

The concept of Ritu-Raithane is part of Vasanta ritu-charya. Ritu means season, and raithane means local; hence, its literal meaning is seasonal and local food. We present local and seasonal foods aligned with Ayurvedic principles to help preserve your optimal health.
